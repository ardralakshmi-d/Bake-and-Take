Project Description

Bake & Take is a web platform designed to connect home bakers with customers looking for fresh, homemade baked goods. The platform enables bakers to showcase their specialties, list available products, manage order limits, and set price ranges. Customers can easily discover home bakers nearby, explore their offerings, and place orders.

The Problem statement

Many home bakers struggle to reach potential customers due to a lack of visibility and an efficient platform for showcasing their specialties. Customers looking for high-quality, homemade baked goods often face difficulties finding reliable and authentic home bakers in their area. There is no seamless system for home bakers to list their products, manage orders, and connect with interested buyers, leading to missed opportunities for both parties.

The Solution

Our project, "Bake & Take", is a web platform that connects home bakers with customers looking for fresh, homemade baked goods. The platform allows bakers to showcase their specialties, describe their authenticity, list available products, set maximum order quantities, and define price ranges. Customers can easily browse nearby home bakers, explore their offerings, and place orders. With an intuitive interface and seamless integration with a MongoDB Atlas backend, the platform provides an efficient, user-friendly experience for both bakers and customers.
